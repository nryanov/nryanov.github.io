# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
CDC is an important part of data processing. Using CDC you can achieve many goals from simple data replication to audit and complex ETL jobs.
But implementing CDC is still a tough task (especially when considering not only happy-path). 
In this article I want to show different ways of implementing CDC. Also, I'll try to not only show how to setup each variant, but also compare them with each other and highlight pros and cons of each option.  

# Prerequisite <a name="prerequisite"></a>
Before we start, let's look at required environment. Most examples can be reproduced using the only postgres instance without any additional setups and it may look like this: 

```yaml
services:
  database:
    image: postgres:17
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres -d postgres"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5
      start_period: 10s
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_DB: postgres
    command:
      - "postgres"
      - "-c"
      - "wal_level=logical"
      - "-c"
      - "max_wal_senders=5"
      - "-c"
      - "max_replication_slots=5"
```

If for any CDC option will additional components will be required it will be highlighted.
